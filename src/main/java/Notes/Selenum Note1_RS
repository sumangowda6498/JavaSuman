1)))Difference Between driver.close() and driver.quit() in Selenium(((1

.

Example:

// Close the current browser window
driver.close();

Key Points:

->Closes the active window or tab.

->Keeps the WebDriver session active if other windows or tabs remain open.

-> If called on the last remaining window or tab, it will terminate the entire browser session


driver.quit()

The driver.quit() method is used to close all open browser windows or tabs and terminate the WebDriver session. This method is typically used at the end of a test script to ensure that all browser instances are closed properly and any associated resources are released.

// Close all browser windows and terminate the WebDriver session
driver.quit();

// Close all browser windows and terminate the WebDriver session
driver.quit();
